# Company-Data-Scraper

A Selenium-based web scraper that navigates through multiple pages of company listings, opens each company profile in a new tab, extracts key company details (name, headquarters, certification date, industry, sector, operating regions, website), and saves the data for analysis.

Features:
- Handles pagination automatically by clicking the "Next" button.
- Opens each company profile in a new browser tab to avoid losing the listing page.
- Robust data extraction with fallbacks for missing information.

Built with Python and Selenium.
